    "| Z-order indexing | method of indexing data in a multi-dimensional space |\n",

    "\n",
    "Z-order indexing is a method of indexing data in a multi-dimensional space, such as a 2D grid or a 3D volume, in such a way that the data can be efficiently queried and sorted based on their spatial coordinates. It is also known as Morton order, Z-curve, and Z-ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Z-order indexing, the data points are assigned a unique integer index based on their coordinates in the multi-dimensional space. The index is calculated using a space-filling curve, such as the Hilbert curve, which maps the points in the space onto a one-dimensional sequence. This allows the data points to be efficiently sorted and queried based on their spatial coordinates, without the need for complex indexing structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-order indexing is often used in computer graphics, databases, and geographic information systems, as it allows for efficient spatial queries and can improve the performance of certain algorithms. It is also useful for data visualization, as it allows for the data points to be plotted in a way that preserves their spatial relationships."
